## Me

I am a CS & IMA double major. I have always been a car enthusiast. I like coding. I like building stuff. I want to focus my capstone on autonomous vehicles. 

## Story

We are moving to a new campus. We will not be able to come back again. I like the old campus. I spend my entire college life here. The new campus means not so much to me. I don’t want the old campus to be forgotten. I want to keep it. I want it to stay in people’s minds. 

## My Skills / Source for Help

I know about Computer Vision. I am taking a Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree from Udacity. I am studying Machine Learning / Artificial Intelligence. I will learn Sensor Fusion. I can learn how to program a robot with Prof. Rudi. I have many experiences with Kinect and point clouds. I have taken a VR/AR course with Prof. Naimark. That can be a way to present my project. I can also ask Prof. Christian for technical details. I have Prof. Chen from CS who is willing to help me with the capstone. 

## My Plan

I want to build a map for our campus. I believe this campus is significant for every student in&before our class (2020). The school may also like it. I want to use a mobile robot, can be a car or a drone. I can use a panoramic camera and stitch the images/videos. I can also use a point cloud from Kinect (available on campus), or some laser scanners (may need to buy). Both of these two ways produce a model. There are ready-to-go commercial solutions. I need funding. The difficulty level should be manageable to me.
